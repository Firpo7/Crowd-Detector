# UNIGE Crowd Detector - Web App

This web app is useful to visualize better the data retrieved from the API presented in the */server/app* directory of the project. The website consists of three pages:
<ul>
  <li><b><i>/</i></b>: The homepage, here are shown the buildings registered in the server</li>
  <li><b><i>buildings</i></b>: here are shown the sensors inside a building chosen by the user</li>
  <li><b><i>stats</i></b>: here are shown some statistics of data collected by the sensor chosen by the user</li>
</ul>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In order to run this component of the project you have to start the server and then fire the following commands from your terminal:
```
cd webapp
npm install     # only the first time
npm start
```
And then from your browser you have to go to `localhost:3000`

There is intentionally no `production build`.

Below an example of the `/building` page:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
